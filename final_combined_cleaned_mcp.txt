Add an
MCP
server in
AI Agent Studio
An
MCP
server hosts the APIs and tools required by an AI
        application to receive and process calls from
MCP
clients.
        The
MCP
server
        governs ingress traffic and
        promotes secure and efficient access to tools. Adding an
MCP
server in the
AI Agent Studio
helps you to leverage the
Model Context Protocol
as a tool
        for an AI
        agent.
Connecting an
MCP
server with the
AI Agent Studio
simplifies the integration process, making it easier to discover and invoke services. This connection enhances security and governance, providing a streamlined setup experience for
                administrators.
Adding an
MCP
server requires you to add an
MCP
server in the
AI Agent Studio
. You can add an
MCP
server
                with one of the following authentication options:
OAuth 2.1
: Add an
MCP
server with an authentication code. For more information, see
Add an MCP server with OAuth 2.1
.
Note:
You can configure an
MID Server
to connect with
MCP Client
by adding it as an MCP server through OAuth 2.1 configuration and selecting the
Use MID server
check box on the respective server's
                            Connection and Credentials Aliases record. For more information about connecting
MCP Client
with an
MID Server
through Connection and Credentials Aliases, see
Set up OAuth integration via MID Server
.
API Key
: Add an
MCP
server with an API Key.
Others
: Add an
MCP
server manually by selecting a Connection and Credential Alias record.
Note:
You
                    must authenticate the users with the
MCP
server to add the
MCP
tool to an AI agent.
                    Without prior authentication, you can’t add the
MCP
servers.

Model Context Protocol Client
Configure the
MCP Client
to execute agentic workflows with AI agents and mapped tools.
Configuring
MCP Client
enables you to:
Incorporate external tools in AI agents built on
ServiceNow
.
Access tools offered on external
MCP
servers.
Integrate
MCP Client
with the
AI Agent Studio
.
By setting up
MCP
servers, AI agents in your environment can leverage external tools
      efficiently, enhancing their ability to perform complex tasks with up-to-date information.
Important:
The
Model Context Protocol Client
application supports the latest
Model Context Protocol
version, which is 2025-06-18. However, the latest version does not include the support for PRM and Elicitation.

Model Context Protocol Client
The
Model Context Protocol
(
MCP
) client in
ServiceNow
is a framework that allows AI agents, such as large language models (LLMs), to interact with and manage
ServiceNow
instances. This interaction takes place within a server-client
    architecture.
Model Context Protocol Client
terminology
MCP
host
The AI application environment where the tasks are initiated.
MCP
client
Manages communication between the host and the
MCP
servers, handling the requests and responses.
The
MCP Client
architecture enables AI agents to extend their capabilities by invoking external systems dynamically, which enables tasks like accessing APIs, databases, or file systems
                in a standardized way.
MCP
server
Provides external functionalities by exposing tools for AI agents to use.
MCP
tools
The external tools exposed by the
MCP
servers to be used by AI agents.
Why use
MCP
tools
MCP
tools enable seamless integration to:
Connect your AI agent with a wide variety of external tools with minimal setup.
Add multiple
MCP
tools to an AI agent to perform a broader range of tasks.
Review and edit tool input parameters as needed before saving.
